# DIY-DD-Wheelbase
A DIY solution for costly direct drive wheelbases! 

As a summer project, and because I am a broke college student, I decided to try and build my own DD simulation wheel using an old hoverboard. This was done in collaboration 
with the open source project known as FFBeast ((https://ffbeast.github.io/docs/en/wheel.html)). I wanted to push the limits of my current knowlage, aswell as learn more about circutry .

Within you will find the entire parts list I chose, aswell as reasoning for each part. I also included a step by step guide on how I assembled my wheel!

I am also working on implimenting a software upgrade to allow users to run mutiple programs in one window (IE FFBeast and force-feeback pedals)to make for a cleaner and more readable UI
